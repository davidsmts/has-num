# num-linalg
Numerical algebraic computation in Haskell

# Current state
Working on this r.a. 5h a week

# Contents
Up Until now only with Integer
- transpose
- matrix multiplication
- handy functions to create matrix / vector
- 

# ToDo's
- Handy Shit:
  - Use other datatypes then Int
  - Basic Matrix math with easy to use operators
  - Create Matrix:
    - Lower Triangle
    - Upper Triangle
    - Unit
    - Diagonal zero
    - certain diagonal
    - quadratic matrix
    
- Direct linear solving:
  -
  
- Matrix factorization:
  - QR
  - LU
  - Cholesky
  -
  
- Problems with eigenvalues:
  - vector iteration
  - QR iteration
  
- Fault analysis:
